/**

 * that there will be n^2 sets in an nxn simulated grid. Finding an open cell
 * will connect the cell being marked to its neighbors --- this means that the
 * set in which the open cell is 'found' will be unioned with the sets of each
 * neighboring cell. The union/find implementation supports the 'find' and
 * 'union' typical of UF algorithms.
